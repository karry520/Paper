\textbf{\songti \zihao{-4}Abstract:}In recent years, the frequent occurrence of natural disasters, especially damage caused by hailstones on house tiles, has resulted in the United States housing
The housing claims industry urgently needs a set of non-damaging, low-cost testing programs for damage to house tiles. With commercial unmanned
The development of the aircraft and the appearance of various detection algorithms based on deep learning have made it possible to pass unmanned testing equipment.
Machines, combined with target detection algorithms instead of workers to detect house tiles become a reality. The study is combed
In recent years, the main target detection algorithm, taking into account the characteristics of tiles and hail, based on SSD: Single Shot
The MultiBox Detector algorithm performs tile damage detection. The main improvements include two points: 1.Adopt Focal
Loss replaces the loss function used in the original paper. Through experiments, this improvement will improve the accuracy by about 2\%;2.Using Soft-NMS instead of NMS, this experiment has improved the accuracy by about 1\%. Integrated two
Improve the program, the final experimental results not only meet the requirements of the insurance industry and detection accuracy reached 65\% mAP,
The detection speed reached 80FPS.~\\
