\textbf{\songti \zihao{-4}Abstract:}In recent years, the frequent occurrence of natural disasters, especially the damage caused by hailstones to house tiles, has led to American housing claims industry is in urgent need of a non-damaging, low-cost detection scheme for house tile damage. With commercial unmanned.The development of the machine and the emergence of various kinds of detection algorithms based on deep learning have made the detection device unmanned.The machine, combined with the target detection algorithm to replace the staff in the house tile detection to become a reality. This study is sorted out.In recent years, the main target detection algorithm,considering the characteristics of tile and hail, is based on SSD: Single Shot.MultiBox Detector\cite{ssd}algorithm for tile damage detection. Its main improvements include two points :1.Focal Loss\cite{focal-loss}replaced the Loss function used in the original text, which improved the accuracy rate by 2\% through experiments.Or so; 2. Using Soft-NMS\cite{soft-nms}instead of NMS, the improved accuracy of the experiment was improved by 1\% to the left.On the right. Combining two kinds of improvement schemes, the final experiment result not only satisfies the requirement of insurance industry\footnote{As long as six Damage is detected in the roof of the house, the identification result is serious, and the roof tile will be replaced by the owner slice}. And detection of chosen It reached $65\%mAP$ and the detection speed reached $80FPS$.
