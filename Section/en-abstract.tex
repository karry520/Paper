\textbf{\songti \zihao{-4}Abstract:}In recent years, the frequent occurrence of natural disasters has led to the urgent need for an undamaged and low-cost detection scheme for house tile damage in the American housing claims industry. With the development of commercial uavs and the emergence of various detection algorithms based on deep learning, it has become a reality to carry out house tile detection by unmanned aerial vehicles. This study by comparing the main target detection algorithm in recent years, considering the characteristics of the tiles, based on the SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector \ cite {SSD} to tile damage detection algorithm, the experimental results meet the requirements of the insurance industry. The detection accuracy reached $65\%$mAP, and the detection speed reached 80fps.
